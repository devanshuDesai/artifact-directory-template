Title:
AUTOBRICK: A system for end-to-end automation of building point labels to Brick turtle files

Abstract:
BRICK is a schema for representing various building equipment,
including but not limited to, HVAC air handling units and carbon dioxide
sensors in different rooms. While the schema is a clear step up over the
current state-of-the-art, its potential is severely hindered because
it is not backwards compatible. This means that converting CSV
files storing building data to a BRICK-compatible data format is a
cumbersome and imperfect process as different systems use different
conventions to denote the same systems. This conversion usually required
human involvement until now. AUTOBRICK is a software tool that automates
this conversion with minimal human intervention and provides an order
of magnitude greater speed up (90x) over the current state of the art.
